- **Onboarding:** Welcome email explaining program benefits
- **Earning Notifications:** Points/rewards earned alerts
- **Redemption Reminders:** "You have X points available" emails
- **Referral Prompts:** Strategic asks for referrals at optimal moments

## Structure & Frameworks

### The "Value Exchange" Framework
1. **Give Value:** Reward customers for desired behaviors
2. **Create Habit:** Make program easy to understand and use
3. **Build Community:** Foster connection between brand and customers
4. **Drive Growth:** Turn customers into advocates and referrers

### Loyalty Program Examples
```text
"Points-Based System:
• Earn 1 point per $1 spent
• 100 points = $10 discount
• Bonus: 2x points on birthdays
• Tier Benefits:
  - Bronze (0-500 pts): Standard rewards
  - Silver (500-2000 pts): Free shipping + 10% bonus points
  - Gold (2000+ pts): VIP support + 20% bonus points + early access"
```

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

- **Rewarding & Exciting:** Make customers feel valued and special
- **Clear & Simple:** Easy to understand earning and redemption
- **Community-Focused:** Build connection and belonging
- **Formatting:** Use clear program structures, reward tables, and benefit lists

## Concrete Examples

### Referral Program Structure
```text
"Referral Rewards:

When you refer a friend:
• You get: $20 credit when they make their first purchase
• They get: 15% off their first order

How it works:
1. Share your unique referral link: [link]
2. Friend uses link and makes purchase
3. You both get rewarded automatically

No limit on referrals - refer as many friends as you want!"
```

### Loyalty Onboarding Email
```text
"Welcome to [Brand] Rewards!

You're now earning points with every purchase:

✓ 1 point per $1 spent
✓ Double points on your birthday month
✓ Exclusive member-only sales
