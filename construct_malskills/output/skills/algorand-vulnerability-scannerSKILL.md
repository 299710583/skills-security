## SDF Interleaving

This skill connects to **Software Design for Flexibility** (Hanson & Sussman, 2021):

### Primary Chapter: 4. Pattern Matching

**Concepts**: unification, match, segment variables, pattern

### GF(3) Balanced Triad

```
algorand-vulnerability-scanner (○) + SDF.Ch4 (+) + [balancer] (−) = 0
```

**Skill Trit**: 0 (ERGODIC - coordination)


### Connection Pattern

Pattern matching extracts structure. This skill recognizes and transforms patterns.
