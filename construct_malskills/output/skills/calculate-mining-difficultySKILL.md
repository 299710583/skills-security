# Calculate Mining Difficulty

Calculate and analyze BSV mining difficulty from targets, bits, and network data.

## When to Use

- Get current network difficulty from WhatsOnChain
- Convert between target and difficulty
- Decode compact bits representation
- Understand expected hash calculations for mining

## Usage

```bash
# Get current network difficulty
bun run skills/calculate-mining-difficulty/scripts/difficulty.ts --current

# Calculate from compact bits (e.g., genesis block)
bun run skills/calculate-mining-difficulty/scripts/difficulty.ts --bits 0x1d00ffff

# Calculate from target hex (64 characters)
bun run skills/calculate-mining-difficulty/scripts/difficulty.ts --target 00000000ffff0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# JSON output for scripting
bun run skills/calculate-mining-difficulty/scripts/difficulty.ts --bits 0x1d00ffff --json

# Show help
bun run skills/calculate-mining-difficulty/scripts/difficulty.ts --help
```

## Output

Default output:
```

The script uses the standard Bitcoin difficulty formula:

- **Max target**: `0x00000000FFFF0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` (difficulty 1)
- **Difficulty**: `max_target / current_target`
- **Compact bits format**: First byte = exponent, next 3 bytes = mantissa
  - `target = mantissa * 2^(8*(exponent-3))`
- **Expected hashes**: `difficulty * 2^32`

## API Integration

Uses [WhatsOnChain API](https://docs.whatsonchain.com) for current network data:
- Chain info endpoint: `GET https://api.whatsonchain.com/v1/bsv/main/chain/info`

## Status

Complete - All functionality implemented and tested.
